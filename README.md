# Multi-purpose-calculator-without-ui
Java calculator that can do multiple functions from basic to quadratic formula and is still in progress. Updates will be made to add a physics formula and chemistry formula section in addition more math formulas and also calculating derivatives and integrals. You will run this directly in your text editor and then run the code. You will need the sqrt.java extension as well for the package motga.java to run. This is not perfect yet and if there is any problems, feel free to do a pull request!
